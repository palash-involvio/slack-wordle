Wordle for Slack! This slack bot downloads the official Wordle bundle from https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/ and executes it in a VM, delivering the results directly to your slack client.  It looks like this:

You can add it to your slack here:

After you have installed the App, you will need to add Wordle to the channel you wish to play in.
